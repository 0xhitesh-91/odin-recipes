<h2>Descrition</h2>
<p>In a country like India where every region cooks up an elaborate menu,
    the best way to explore any regional cuisine would be to settle for a thali.
    It is an absolute delight to eat a little bit of everything from the best 
    that a cuisine can offer.Every regional cuisine is laced with ingredients
    that are abundantly available with them while working with substitutes for 
    the scarce food items. Rajasthan is a dry state and because of this, people 
    have learned to cook with milk, buttermilk, cream and curd to save water.
    From the exquisite spread of preparations, where vegetarian dishes are at 
    par with the non-vegetarian fare, to the beautiful Rajasthani plates and brazen 
    bowls its served in, if you haven't had a Rajasthani thali yet, it's about time 
    you do.The Royal PlatterA traditional Rajasthani thali depicts a brilliant play 
    of gourmet preparations on a plate of epic proportions. The meticulous arrangements 
    of curries, pickles, special breads and desserts would delight one and all.
